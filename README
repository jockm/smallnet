Differences with real c#:
* no garbage collector (you must use dispose method)
* vars has not defaults values (for optimization)
* no exceptions (to avoid memory leaks because the lack of GC)
* by default numbers (ex. 1234) are signed integers but you can change this:
    123'i  -> is a signed integer
    123'ui -> is an unsigned integer
    123'b  -> is a signed byte
    123'ub -> is an unsigned byte
  123+123 and 123'b+123'b and 123'ub+123'ub gives different results
  signed and unsigned are basically the same except for comparing numbers

TODO:
* add uses directives
* type casting
* static methods
* register spilling
* class tags
* non-static methods
* non-static fields
* nested namespaces
* nested classes
* strings
* conditionals and loops
* memory manager
* tool for roms (using pragmas maybe?)
* declare same method with different args
* box/unbox basic types
* save modified regs in a method (except return types)

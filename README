Differences with real c#:
* no garbage collector (you must use dispose method)
* vars has not defaults values (for optimization)
* no exceptions (to avoid memory leaks because the lack of GC)
* by default numbers (ex. 1234) are signed integers but you can change this:
    123'int -> is a signed integer
    123'uint -> is an unsigned integer
    123'byte -> is a signed byte
    123'ubyte -> is an unsigned byte
  123+123 and 123'byte+123'byte and 123'ubyte+123'ubyte gives different results
  123'int and 123'uint are basically the same except comparing numbers

TODO:
* type casting
* static methods
* register spilling
* class tags
* non-static methods
* non-static fields
* nested namespaces
* nested classes
* strings
* conditionals and loops
* memory manager
* use pragmas for create roms
* declare same method with different args
* box/unbox basic types
